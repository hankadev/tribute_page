      <blockquote>"There is no doubt that the princess did become a queen not only on the screen. One of the most loved, one of the most skillful, one of the most intelligent, one of the most sensitive, charming actresses and friends, in my life but also in the later
        stages of her life, the UNICEF ambassador to the children of the world. The generosity, sensitivity, the nobility of her service to the children of the world and the mothers of the world will never be forgotten."</blockquote>
