# Tribute page
This is my implementation of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Tribute page project.

I did not used any library. I built this project using my HTML, CSS and media queries skills.

## Objective
Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW).
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

User stories:
* __User Story #1:__ My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements.
* __User Story #2:__ I should see an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
* __User Story #3:__ I should see a `div` element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`.
* __User Story #4:__ Within the `img-div` element, I should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`.
* __User Story #5:__ Within the `img-div` element, I should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`.
* __User Story #6:__ I should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
* __User Story #7:__ I should see an a element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`).
* __User Story #8:__ The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
