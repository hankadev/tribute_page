# Tribute page
This is my implementation of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Tribute page project.

I did not used any library. I built this project using my HTML, CSS and media queries skills.

## Objective
Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW).
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

User stories:
